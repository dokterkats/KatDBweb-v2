*Hello fellow VR enthusiasts!* KatVR just announced the launch of their latest product, the Kat Walk C2 Core, with pre-orders opening on August 1st. This new addition to the KatVR lineup promises an immersive virtual reality experience with a more budget-friendly approach, while still retaining the core functionalities of its predecessor, the Kat Walk C2.

## Familiar Optical Sensor System and Base Size

Just like the Kat Walk C2, the C2 Core utilizes the same reliable and accurate optical sensor system. This ensures that your in-game movements are accurately translated to the virtual environment, enhancing the sense of presence and immersion.

Additionally, the Kat Walk C2 Core shares the same base size as its predecessor, offering a familiar platform for gamers to step into their favorite virtual worlds.

## Enhanced Comfort and Improved Jumping Experience

The C2 Core brings about certain ergonomic improvements compared to the C2. The back piece of the Kat Walk C2 Core is taller, making jumping movements easier and allowing for smoother up and down motions. This enhanced design contributes to a more comfortable and seamless gameplay experience.

## Lower Shipping Costs

The Kat Walk C2 Core comes with a significant reduction in shipping costs, approximately 50% less than the shipping cost of the original C2. This reduction ensures that players from all around the world can get their hands on this innovative VR without going broke on the shipping costs.

## Introducing a Pulley-less System

Learning from the experiences with the original C2, KatVR has introduced a new pulley-less system on the backplate of the C2 Core. The removal of the pulley system addresses a previous vulnerability and enhances the overall durability of the product. On the Kat Walk C2, the pulley on the backplate was prone to snap. Using a pulley-less system should resolve this issue.

## Improved Adjustability with Backpiece Rotation

The Kat Walk C2 Core features a convenient turn knob on the back, allowing users to adjust the rotation of the backpiece to their preference. This personalized customization ensures that users can fine-tune their VR experience for optimal comfort.

## The Price and Future Possibilities

The Kat Walk C2 Core is available for pre-order at a special price of $899, with the retail price set at $999. For those seeking even more immersion, a seat module is in the works, although it might be important to note that the seat module of the C2 is not compatible with the C2 Core.
