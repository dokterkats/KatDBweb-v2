### Notes:
There is an Auto-Sprint mod available. I haven't tested it myself but the description sounds promising: 
<blockquote>
"This mod will allow you to sprint without having to double tap the analog stick. Your speed will increase from walking to sprinting as you go from the deadzone to full-tilt."
</blockquote>

You can find the mod [here](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/Lanno/AlwaysSprinting/)
