### Notes:
This flat PC game needs to be modded to work in VR (and can be modded to work with bHaptics and a ProVolver) and works very well with my C2.  It has a "dash" feature (like teleport movement as opposed to a faster run speed) that can be bound to the movement Joystick press button in the Gateway by selecting "Run Source" (as in the game) to "Press/Push."  This means once you physically walk at a fast enough speed it will engage the dash movement in game.  This is fun but less precise than pushing the dash button on the controller, especially since you cannot specify the speed at which dash activates.  However since attacking on beat per this rhythm game is already a lot to think about, it might be easier to set this to press/push.  I have a video with gameplay with the C2 on my YouTube channel, [Ender's VRcade](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/46T9ihie8vg).
### Rating Info:
**Walking speed realism:** It appears to be a fixed walking speed that is relatively low regardless of real world/C2 walking running speed but the dash feature makes up for it. (3 points) <br><br>
**World Size:** The game has a mix of small, moderate and-or large-sized worlds that are easy to navigate. (3 points) <br><br>
**Responsiveness:** The game is responsive to the user's movements with minimal delays or inaccuracies. (3 points) <br><br>
**Sprinting:** The sprinting mechanics are responsive and realistic (3 points) <br><BR>
**Sprinting mechanic:** The game supports sprinting and you do not have to press any button to sprint after adjusting the in-game settings (3 points) <br><br>
**Decoupled head/body:** The game supports decoupled head/body walking after adjusting the in-game settings.

**Entry info:** The game was tested using a **Oculus Quest**on the **Kat Walk C2**.
