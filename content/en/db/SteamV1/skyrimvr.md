### Notes
Best with mods, feel free to ask in the KatVR Community discord for help!.

#### Scoring explanaion:
Skyrim VR *does require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic. You need to change the walking speed within Skyrim to match your desired rate.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Quest* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway version 2.0.9*.
