#### Scoring explanation:
PAYDAY 2 does not allow for *sprinting*.
The world *is not* large enough to be enjoyable to explore on a KatVR device.
The movement speed does *not* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement by default.

This game was tested on a *Pimax 5K Plus* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway 2.1.0*.
