## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐

### Notes
When using the Quest the game only works with the Kat Walk when launched trough virtual desktop/steam when tested. [Windows 7 workaround](https://katwalk.fandom.com/wiki/Oculus_Workaround:_Windows_7_Compatibility_Mode) might be a solution.

#### Scoring explanaion:
Phasmaphobia does *require* a joystick press to sprint.
There *world* is large enough to comfortably walk around in.
Phasmaphobia has a set walking speed that is part of the game play, sprint mode is a short action playable by the character.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Quest* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway Version 2.0.8*
