## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
Set the input vector to Head in the in-game settings for decoupled head-body movement direction.

### Scoring explanation:
Wakamarina Valley, NZ *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
