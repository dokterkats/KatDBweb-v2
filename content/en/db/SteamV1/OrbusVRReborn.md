⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
Have to choose between snap turning and strafe - at the moment, you cannot have both

### Scoring explanaion:
Orbus VR Reborn *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a huge world to explore.
The movement is generally *fast*.
Couldn't get decoupled head-body movement working at time of testing. 
Tested on a *Oculus Rift S* using the *Kat Walk C2+*
