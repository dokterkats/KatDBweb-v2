### Notes
It is capable of linear locomotion by joystick sensitivity testing, but does not respond accordingly with the Kat Walk C.

### Scoring explanaion:
Apex Construct *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint. There is no sprint, although variable speeds exist, when using the Kat Walk C alone, it is always simply "fast".
There are *several* isolated maps, which are each somewhat narrow.
The movement speed is always *fast*. Reggardless of the Gateway settings. 
The game *does not* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* using the *Kat Walk C2+*.
