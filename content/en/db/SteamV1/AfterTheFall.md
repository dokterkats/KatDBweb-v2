⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
There is a option available for auto-sprint in the settings

### Scoring explanation:
After The Fall *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
