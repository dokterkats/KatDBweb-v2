## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
The base game requires a MOD as its not VR.  The Firewatch VR mod is presently free on Github and ItchIO.  It works very well.

#### Scoring explanaion:
FirewatchVR *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.

The game was tested on a *HTC Vive* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway 2.1.0 BETA*.
