### Notes
Uses hand movement for sprinting and jumping

### Scoring explanation:
Stride *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *are multiple* large worlds to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
