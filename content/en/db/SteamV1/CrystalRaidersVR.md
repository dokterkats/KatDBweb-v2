⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
Make sure to set the movement orientation to body in the Kat Gateway.

### Scoring explanaion:
Crystal Raiders VR *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
