## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐


### Scoring explanation:
Pangman *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
The world *is not* large enough to be enjoyable to explore on a KatVR device.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
